NAME
    Games::Go::Rank - Represents a player's rank in the game of Go

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        use Games::Go::Rank;

        my $black_rank = Games::Go::Rank->new(rank => '1k');
        my $white_rank = Games::Go::Rank->new(rank => '2d');
        if ($white_rank > $black_rank) {
            # ...
        }

DESCRIPTION
    This class represents a player's rank in the game of Go. Rank objects
    can be compared to see whether two ranks are equal or whether one rank
    is higher than the other. Rank objects stringify to the rank notation.

    Use the standard notation for ranks such as "30k", "5k", "1d", "2p" and
    so on. You can also use other common formats such as "6-dan" or "2 dan".
    Anything after the first "k", "d" or "p" is ignored. So "6-dan*" is the
    same as "6-dan", which is the same as "6d".

METHODS
  as_value
    Returns a number representing the rank. "1k" is returned as 0, lower kyu
    ranks are returned as negative numbers ("2K" is -1, "3k" is -2 etc.).
    Dan ranks are returned as positive numbers, with pro ranks coming
    immediately after dan ranks. For example, "1d" == 1, "7d" == 7, "1p" ==
    8, "2p" == 9. Only dan ranks up to 7d are recognized as amateur ranks -
    that is, "8d" == "1p".

  from_value
    Sets the rank from a numerical value that is interpreted as described
    above.
